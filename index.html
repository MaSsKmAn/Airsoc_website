        We are a student body from IIT Roorkee who are interset in UAV design
        and want to get some new and efficient techniques to improve the
        performance of these glider and drone. we also compete among inter IIT
        competition's to showcase our skills.
        Here are few glimpses of our journey.

            Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or remotely piloted aircraft (RPAs), are aircraft without a human pilot on board. They can be operated remotely by a human operator or autonomously by onboard computers. Drones come in various shapes and sizes, from small quadcopters used for recreational purposes to large, fixed-wing drones used for military and commercial applications.
            
            Drones have a wide range of uses, including:
            <ul class="list1">
            <li class="v">Photography and Videography: Drones equipped with high-quality cameras are used for capturing stunning aerial shots for photography and filmmaking.
            </li> 
            <li class="v">Agriculture: Drones are used in precision agriculture to monitor crops, spray pesticides, and assess crop health.
            </li>
        <li class="v">Search and Rescue: Drones equipped with thermal cameras and other sensors can be used to search for missing persons or survey disaster areas.
        </li> 
    <li class="v">Delivery: Companies are exploring the use of drones for delivering packages to customers, especially in remote areas.
    </li>       
<li class="v">   Mapping and Surveying: Drones can be used to create detailed maps and 3D models of terrain, buildings, and other features.
</li>           
<li class="v">       Monitoring and Surveillance: Drones are used for monitoring wildlife, tracking poachers, and surveilling borders and infrastructure.
</li>           
<li class="v">       Disaster Response: Drones can be deployed quickly to assess damage and aid in disaster response efforts.
</li>           
<li class="v">       Entertainment: Drones are used in light shows and other entertainment events to create dazzling aerial displays.

            A glider is a type of aircraft that does not have an engine and is designed to fly using only the natural forces of lift, gravity, and air currents. Gliders are typically launched into the air by being towed behind a powered aircraft or by being winched into the air using a cable. Once airborne, gliders are able to stay aloft by using rising air currents, such as thermals, ridge lift, or wave lift.
        </li>
           <li> Glider design can vary widely, from simple, lightweight models used for recreational flying to more advanced, high-performance gliders used in competitive soaring. Gliders are often constructed from lightweight materials such as fiberglass, carbon fiber, or aluminum, and they are designed to be aerodynamically efficient to maximize their performance in the air.
        </li>
    <li> Glider pilots use their skill and knowledge of weather conditions to stay aloft for extended periods of time and to navigate long distances. Gliding is a popular sport and recreational activity enjoyed by people around the world.
